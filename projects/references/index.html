          <p><em>Note: This is skipping the process of getting all the files AND printing them out.</em></p>
        <h3>Putting it all together</h3>
          <p>I used Gorilla Gel Super Glue to put together the bottom pieces first. I used clamps to hold the ends to get as close to a perfect line-up as possible. I did the following for the middle layer and the top layer.</p>
          <p>Once I have the three layers put together (remember this was printed on an Ender 3 Pro. CR-10, or printers with bigger beds, could print is less pieces than mine) I glued the bottom and middle together, then put the top dome on.</p>
          <p>Of course, the glue isn't the strongest in the world... in the beginning I actually dropped the first two pieces and it didn't stick. However, after all the pieces are fully assembled, I used a 5 minute epoxy to strengthen the seams. (At the end of the project I superglued the seams one last time along with the visor for one final protection.)</p>
          <p>After the glue and assembly period is complete, it's time to take care of the print lines.</p>
        <h3>Bondooo</h3>
          <p>I followed <a style="color: rgb(250, 90, 90); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.youtube.com/user/JustTheBigBaby">Galactic Armory's process</a>, however I want to document my personal process and experience, even if it is similar.</p>
          <p style="text-indent: 2em;"><em>Other sources for techniques were from <a style="color: rgb(250, 90, 90); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YNL0qx3BEKA">Tethan Props</a> and <a style="color: rgb(250, 90, 90); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC70YIbdCTrXgnegjVHbLt-A">PatchBOTS</a></em></p>
          <p>I went outside with a <strong>RESPIRATOR</strong> and put Bondo Glazing and Spot Putty all over the helmet, except in the smaller details which would be hard to sand. Once the bondo has hardened, I sanded it with 120 grit sandpaper until it was fairly smooth. If there was a rough spot I put more Bondo over it and sanded it again.</p>
          <p>Once I was happy with the sanding, I moved on to filler primer. I had Rust-Oleum Primer White, so it was the base coat as well. I had a few areas where the spray paint ran so I sanded and smoothened out rough spots, especially the seam lines. After I felt confident with what I had, I put two more layers of filler primer before moving onto painting.</p>
        <h3>Painting</h3>
          <p>I started off with the stripe. I used masking tape, following the <a style="color: rgb(250, 90, 90); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://databank.501st.com/databank/Costuming:CT_-_501st_Legion">501st Legion measurements</a> with my general eye to mask the stripe. Once the masking tape was on, I put blue painters tape around the outer edges to secure it more. To cover the rest of the helmet I used grocery bags, taped using the painters tape. Before the paint, to recreate battle damage, I used liquid latex using a small paint brush over the area to be painted. For the paint, I used Rust-Oleum Nantucket Blue. PatchBOTS used Krylon Global Blue, however I personally was satisfied with the look of it, either would look acceptable. I let the paint dry for about an hour, before I took off the tape and let it dry completely over night.</p>
          <p>I repeated the process for the black brim stripe and grey inside area on the dome. I again used Rust-Oleum "grey and black" (I don't remember specific name). I did not use the liquid latex for these parts.</p>
          <p>On the frown, vocoder, and grill lookin' things on the sides of the vocodor (I can't think of the name right now), I hand painted them using acrylic black paints. However, on the frown on the outer frown I used a mix of black and white to get that <em>perfect</em> grey.</p>
          <p>Now comes the most fun part...</p>
        <h3>WEATHERINGGG</h3>
          <p>For the weathering process I followed Galactic Armory's method by mixing black acryic paint and water and using a sponge brush all... over... the helmet.</p>
          <p>Personally, I wanted a very damaged look, so I went all out. It all depends on if you want a shiny or not. For me, I was satisfied with the weathered white color, but I wasn't happy with the corners, so I went even more, especially on the sides. I didn't have a perfect masking job so I went in with a fine brush with black acrylic paint in the corners to show more dirt and grime (especially on the brim since that was difficult to mask). In addition to the weathering, I looked up a picture of a 501st helmet and saw some numbering and a very defined bullet mark, so I added those in with the paint brush, firstly smudging it with my finger to add some depth and then with a finer brush making the defined marks.</p>
        <h3>VISOR</h3>
          <p>Galactic Armory recommended a Hobart face shield, however I couldn't find any on Amazon so I got a <a style="color: rgb(250, 90, 90); font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LB4P72/">Sellstrom Replacement Window.</a> I thought I got black but in the light it was a dark green. I wasn't really upset as you couldn't tell unless you shined a light on it or looked through it. In my opinion, I remember on the original Battlefront 2 the 501st Grunts had a "dark green" visor so I was actually very pleased with the cards I was dealt.</p>
          <p>I measured roughly with a paper and pencil of the outline, and cut a rectangular shape out of the visor. Since this was my first time, I didn't go as exact as Galactic Armory did, but rather bit by bit I removed a piece until I got something that fit good. I superglued it in, and used a lot more superglue than was needed, but I wanted it to be very secure. I started on one end, pushing on the visor to be as flush as possible, and glued. I did this on the other side as well and finished in the middle. Since the helmet was a little big on me, I reused some of the foam from the Ender 3 Pro shipping box and cut out and superglued it in the helmet until I got a snug fit at eye level.</p>
          <p>Now the helmet sits and collects dust... Nevertheless, it is still unreal to look at and is, in a way, a dream come true.</p>
